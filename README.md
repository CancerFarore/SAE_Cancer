## Project description
The goal is to develop a conversational chatbot using the Keras NLP library's GPT-2 model as a base.

It will be able to engage in natural conversations with users, answer their questions in a specific field (see Dataset part), and submit useful information.

The chatbot will answer in **English**.

You can refer to the subject <a href="SAE-IA.pdf">SAE-IA.pdf</a> (which is in **French**)

## Team members
For each milestone (Livrable), a manager will be chosen.

Here are the team members and those who were managers. 
There is no manager for **Livrable 1** since we just have to constitute a team for this milestone.

* Yassine BELLAGRAA (Livrable 6)
* Amadou DIA
* Salma BOUSSERHANE (Livrable 5)
* Walid OUBELLA
* Maxime NGUYEN (Livrable 3)
* Selma MAZGAR (Livrable 2)
* Chrinovic KIBANGU TSIMBA (Livrable 4)

When a student is a manager, he has some tasks to perform:
* Plan or replan tasks
* Communicate milestones to team members and the teachers
* Evaluate tasks completion
* Create a management report

## Resources
* GPT-2 model from the Keras NLP library for fine-tuning and text generation: https://keras.io/keras_nlp/
* Gradio for the UI/frontend of the chatbot: https://www.gradio.app/
* Python Jupyter and Google Notebooks for testing the chatbot

## Dataset
The dataset we will use is from Kaggle and is about records from people affected by cancer : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/falgunipatel19/biomedical-text-publication-classification 

## Deployment
The code and the Gradio application will be submitted to a Hugging Face repository, which can be found here:
